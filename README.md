# The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern: This is one of the oldest and most well-established architectural patterns. It separates the user interface (view) from the data and business logic (model) and the control flow (controller). In a Flutter app, the view is typically implemented using widgets, while the model and controller are typically implemented as Dart classes.
